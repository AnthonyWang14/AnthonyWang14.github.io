I am a tenure-track Associate Professor in School of Management, University of Science and Technology of China. Before that, I was a research fellow in School of Physics and Mathematical Science (SPMS) at [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), advised by Prof. Zhenzhen Yan. Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. at NTU, supervised by Prof. Xiaohui Bei, and graduated with B.E. in computer science and B.S. (double major) in economics at Tsinghua University. Here is my [CV](https://AnthonyWang14.github.io/files/HAOW_CV_Oct.pdf).

My research interests include topics at the interface between operations research, computer science and economics.  
Most recently, I have been studying problems in  
* Online Resource Allocation, Online Learning and Data-Driven Algorithms
* Large Language Model for Online Decision Making

***If you are interested in these topics, please feel free to contact me!***
